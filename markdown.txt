This mod makes activating the teleporter a challenge of its own!
Upon triggering a teleporter, you will be greeted with a challenge of one of two groups: the ***Puzzles*** and the ***Challenges***!
Additionally, Providence has set up some security on the ship's blast doors, so get ready to face some **Panel** challenges!

## **Puzzles**

If you like brain teasers, these are for you! Interacting a teleporter will present you with a puzzle you need to solve to be able to activate the teleporter as usual.
In singleplayer, *time will stop while you attempt to solve the puzzle*. However, if you're playing online, **time will not stop**, so make sure someone is looking out for you...
Use the **movement keys** and/or the **first skill/jump button** to interact with the puzzles.
#### Available puzzles:
+ **Ball Maze** - Guide the little square from the green starting point to the red ending point by rotating the maze with the **left/right keys**!
+ **Latch Spin** - Press **attack/jump** in time to toggle all of the slices and complete the circle!
+ **Slide Puzzle** - Often called the 8-Puzzle. Use the **left/right keys** to slide the pieces in order to reveal one of RoR's many enemies!
+ **Lock Pick** - Better have that Lockpicking skill at 100! Rotate the pick using **left/right keys**, then hold **attack/jump** to attempt to pick at that angle!

## **Challenges**

These make activating the teleporter a bit more fun than just getting to it and pressing a button. Unlike puzzles, these do not require thinking hard, but they do require some effort.
#### Available challenges:
+ **Moving Teleporter** - Dear god, it jumps! It can be activated like normal a few seconds afterwards (if you can catch up to it..)
+ **Shadow Clones** - Some sneaky Imps disguised themselves as teleporters! Can you find the correct one?
+ **Piece Gathering** - The teleporter broke down! Hunt the required pieces to fix it (but you can only carry one at a time)
+ **Teleporter Guardian** - Uh oh, this spirit doesn't seem to be happy, run from it while dodging missiles! While inside its aura, the teleporter will not count down!

## **Panels**

Triggering a blast door will require some technical know-how. Have fun with these puzzles! Much like the puzzles, these will stop time in singleplayer only.
#### Available challenges:
+ **Roulette** - Line up the letters in the correct order to unlock the door!
+ **Hacking** - How's your Science skill, Wanderer/Courier? Pick different words and check for correct letter positions in a Mastermind-like minigame!
