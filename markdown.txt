This mod makes activating the teleporter a challenge of its own!
Upon triggering a teleporter, you will be greeted with a challenge of one of two groups: the ***Puzzles*** and the ***Challenges***!

## **Puzzles**
If you like brain teasers, these are for you! Interacting a teleporter will present you with a puzzle you need to solve to be able to activate the teleporter as usual.
If you're in singleplayer, *time will stop while you attempt to solve the puzzle*. However, if you're playing online, **time will not stop**, so make sure someone is looking out for you...
#### Available puzzles:
+ **Ball Maze** - Guide the little square from the green starting point to the red ending point by rotating the maze with the **left/right keys**!
+ **Latch Spin** - Press **Spacebar** in time to toggle all of the slices and complete the circle!
+ **Slide Puzzle** - Often called the 8-Puzzle. Use the **left/right keys** to slide the pieces in order to reveal one of RoR's many enemies!

## **Challenges**
These make activating the teleporter a bit more fun than just getting to it and pressing a button. Unlike puzzles, these do not require thinking hard, but they do require some effort.
#### Available challenges:
+ **Moving Teleporter** - Dear god, it jumps! It can be activated like normal a few seconds afterwards (if you can catch up to it..)
+ **Shadow Clones** - Some sneaky Imps disguised themselves as teleporters! Can you find the correct one?
